## Project Title: Monitoring Employee's Emotional Well-being with GoogleNet Using the FER2013 Dataset

### Overview
This project utilizes a pre-trained neural network, GoogleNet, to monitor employees' emotional well-being by analyzing facial expressions. The system leverages the FER2013 dataset, containing 30,000 labelled grayscale facial images, to classify emotions such as anger, disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality.

Objectives
- Implement emotion detection using GoogleNet and FER2013 dataset.
- Develop a method to monitor employees' emotional states over time.
- Analyze emotional data to identify trends and patterns in employee well-being.
